Hi everyone,

This is just a gentle reminder on safely driving to practice at the lake.

We have 12-13 drivers and 33 passengers so far (14 who have not sent in forms or checks). So that means if a driver is sick or unable to drive, we will have to do a little shifting around. 

Drivers, please let your passengers know if you can't make practice. Passengers, please let your driver know if you will miss practice so no one is waiting around at school. Practice is mandatory, so let coach know if you are sick. Please exchange phone numbers so you can call and text.

Drivers, please have everyone buckle up, drive safely and do not use the gravel roads. Use State Street/Moon Road south turn left on Bemis (East)  to Carpenter or Stony Creek turn left go to Textile (turn right ) continue east to Lakeside Park. Not sure if you can park in the boat house parking lot. You'll find out tomorrow. Otherwise park in the Park lot. (12 miles one way about 22 minutes, avoiding Michigan Ave. traffic especially coming back)

Drivers have some garbage bags in your cars and passengers, bring plastic bags for wet, muddy shoes. Please respect your drivers cars.

That's it! Everyone have a great first day at the new boat house!
