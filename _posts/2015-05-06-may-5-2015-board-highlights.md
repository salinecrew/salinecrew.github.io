The Saline Rowing Club held our May board meeting last night and here are a few
of the highlights from the meeting.

-   Salt Springs Sprints – the club is hosting the inaugural Salt Springs
    Sprints this Saturday, May 9 at the new boathouse. There will be 7 teams
    competing including our team. We are in the final stages of planning this
    event and have had lots of help from many of the parents. Those who are
    volunteering, please meet at the boathouse Saturday morning at 7:00.
