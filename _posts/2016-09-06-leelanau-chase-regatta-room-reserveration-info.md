title:  Leelanau Chase Regatta Room Reservation Info  
...

Hello Rowing parents,

This is the reservation info for the Leelanau Chase regatta 10/30.  The
room block is at the Country Inn and Suites in Traverse City.  I
reserved some rooms for Friday night so families can take advantage of
the whole weekend up north if they'd like.  

The rooms will be held until 9/28 at the group rate.  The rate includes
breakfast.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Go Hornets!

Judy Inge
