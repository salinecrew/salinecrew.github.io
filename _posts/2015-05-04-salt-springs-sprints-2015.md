As you know, this Saturday we are hosting the inaugural Salt Springs Sprints.
This is a big day for the program as we not only get to showcase our new
boathouse to other teams but this is the first of what we hope to make an annual
tradition and an event that teams from all over the mid-west will be fighting to
compete in.

I want to thank everyone who has already signed up as a volunteer to help on
Saturday. If you have not yet signed up, please visit the [Sign Up
Genius](http://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f0a4dafab2ba2f49-salt) and volunteer
today. We need help from everyone to make this event a success for all of the
competitors and make them want to come back next year. A link has been added to
the team site for information on the Salt Springs Sprints. Continue to check the
team site <http://salinecrew.org> for updates throughout the week.

Thank you for your support of the team and GO HORNETS!
