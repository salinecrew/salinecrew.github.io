title: "Parents PULL - Powering Up for each Regatta"
---

Keeping our rowers well-nourished while away from home is a big part of the total Crew package. To that end, we have developed a food program for rowers and rower guests alike.  Each season a portion of the rower fees go toward feeding the rowers at each regatta. For an additional, per regatta fee, our club extends the food offering to anyone who comes to watch the regattas, we love a crowd and welcome grandparents, siblings, friends, etc. to cheer our hornets to victory!

As you can imagine, we consume a lot of food during the course of a regatta, our rowers burn through the calories quickly. Not only do we have an obligation to feed them, let’s face it, everyone whether rowing or not, gets a little hungry! Since we have time to kill between those calorie consuming races, it’s easy to lend a hand in the food experience.

The endeavor takes many volunteers, from cooks to dish washers and from trailer unloading to table stocking there is a job for everyone.  We ask that all parents sign up for a volunteer job at the regattas, working together helps makes for a smooth regatta and sometimes leads to a lot of laughs!

> *You can edit the volunteer list online in Google Sheets. Please do so, so we have a real-time accounting of who has volunteered for what.*

Didn’t have time to sign up? No worries, a good rule of thumb is that if you see that someone needs help or that something needs to be done, don’t be shy jump in and contribute.

Signing up to partake in the food experience is an easy 4 step process:

  1. Review and/or download the [tentative food menu](<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qXjPJ7_1cmW8t32qK0IoAvMdOPZ6VDcUMUMVTtJ_E3c/edit?usp=sharing>)
  2. Plan your food needs using the worksheet found at the link above.
  3. Pay for your regatta food via [Payschools](https://www.payschools.com/cat.asp?id=C740BA23A6504DACBD07791491B63467).
  4. Meet the deadline of food payment on the **Tuesday before each regatta**.

The club understands that not everyone can commit to signing up for food 5 days in advance, please feel free on those occasions to pack a picnic and join us anyway.  Although our goal is to make sure that no rowers go without the necessary caloric requirements on a performance day, our stretch objective is to make it an enjoyable and inclusive experience for all.
