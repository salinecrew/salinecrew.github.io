Smart phones are so amazing. I was looking at the photos and videos I took
yesterday on my smart phone. I noticed a little movie icon and clicked it. It
stitched together the videos and photos into an instant movie. The hardest part
was figuring out how to upload the darn thing.

This is by no means the final story on photos for the event. Nicole and Heidi
did an amazing job of covering the event from start to finish (literally). They
will be assembling a photo montage in the next couple of days.

Do you have photos you want to share? Send me a link to your online photos (make
sure they're publicly shared) and I'll post them with the other photos.
