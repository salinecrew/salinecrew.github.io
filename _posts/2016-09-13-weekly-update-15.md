...

Our first regatta is less than 2 weeks away and the team is now on the
water shaking off the summer cobwebs and preparing for the start of the
fall season. Here are updates and reminders for the week:

**Practice**  
The team practice schedule is Monday - Thursday at the boathouse on Ford
Lake.

**Regatta**  
The first regatta of the season is the Frogtown Regatta, Saturday,
September 24 in Toledo, Ohio. Race information and directions will be
sent out next week.

**Regatta Food and Volunteer Sign-Up**  
We are in the process of creating the signups for regatta volunteers and
parent/guest regatta meal purchases. I will send out a reminder with
additional information and links later this week.

**New Rower Meeting**  
If you have a new rower or know someone who is interested, please pass
the word that our Fall 2016 New Rower Meeting is Monday, September 19 at
7:00 in the Liberty School Media Center.

**Oscar's Fundraiser**  
Mark your calendars! Maria and Oscar have generously agreed to host
another fundraiser at Oscar's Sports & Grill on Sunday, October 2. We
will send out flyers later this week. Oscar's will donate 20% of the
bill for anyone who brings a copy of the flyer and presents it at
checkout.

**Saline Sports Passes**  
As a part of the team, all rowers receive a Saline H.S. Student Sports
Pass. The rowers need to go to the athletic department and let them know
they are part of the rowing team to claim their pass.

**Forms**  
The following forms are required for the fall season can be found at:
<http://salineRowing.org/forms-maps-downloads/>

-   Saline Schools Participation Form (form is completed online and
    collected by the school)
-   Sports Physical (must be turned in directly to the Athletic
    Department before a rower can compete)
-   Rower Team Transportation Authorization Form

Thanks and as always GO HORNETS!!!
