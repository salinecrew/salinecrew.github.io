title: 'Salt Springs Sprints Volunteers Needed'
---
On May 9, the team will be hosting the inaugural Salt Springs Sprints regatta.
This is a big event not only for the club this year but as we set the stage for
future regattas at Ford Lake. The team will need help from EVERYONE to make this
a success. Please see the [signup
genius](http://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f0a4dafab2ba2f49-salt) for the race and
sign up as soon as possible so that we know we have enough help to hold the
event. We will be holding a couple of additional planning meetings before the
race to make sure everyone is set so keep a look out for additional notices
soon.
