Greetings everyone. This weekend, the team finally gets to take to the water and compete after some much needed time off this summer. Here are your weekly rowing notes:

**Practice**
The team practice schedule is Monday - Thursday at the boathouse on Ford Lake. Thursday will be a little longer as the team will load the boats on the trailer for the regatta this weekend.

**Regatta**
The first regatta of the season is this Saturday, the Frogtown Regatta Toledo, Ohio. Report times and directions will be sent out next week. Here is a link to Regatta Central for race information.

**Regatta Meals**
The link on the team website for the Saline Schools Web Store is now accepting payments for parent and guest meals at our regattas. The cost is $10 for adults and $5 for children. Orders must be placed by the end of day on the Tuesday before a race so that our volunteers have time to plan and shop for food for the upcoming week. Here is a direct link: <https://saline.revtrak.net/tek9.asp?pg=products&grp=31>

**Regatta Volunteers**
The Volunteer Signup link is now up and running on the team website. Remember, it takes help from everyone involved to make our regattas run smooth and efficient. Sign up today! <http://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f0a4dafab2ba2f49-20162>

**New Rower Meeting**
If you have a new rower or know someone who is interested, please pass the word that our Fall 2016 New Rower Meeting is tonight, Monday, September 19 at 7:00 in the Liberty School Media Center.

**Oscar's Fundraiser**
I have attached the flyer for the team fundraiser at Oscar's on Sunday, October 2. A paper copy of the flyer needs to be presented at payment in order for the club to get credit. Spread the word!

**Saline Sports Passes**
As a part of the team, all rowers receive a Saline H.S. Student Sports Pass. The rowers need to go to the athletic department and let them know they are part of the rowing team to claim their pass.

Look for an email later this week with details for the race this weekend. Have a great week and GO HORNETS!!!
