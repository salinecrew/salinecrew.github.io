As weather goes, we had a great day. A little wet in the morning, but by race
time the rain stopped. Overcast skies kept the temperatures in the 70's most of
the day making for comfortable conditions.

We finished 1st in the Mens Varsity 8, 2nd in the Women's Varsity 8 and 1st in
the Women's 2X Varsity. Overall, Saline finished 4th for both the Men's and
Women's divisions. Considering the smallish size of our team, that's an
outstanding result. Go Hornets!
