**Fall Team Banquet**:  
Just a reminder that the Fall banquet is this Wednesday, November 18
from 7-8:30 in the Saline High School Commons. The team will provide
refreshments. If you have a male rower, we ask that you bring a small
appetizer to pass. If you have a female rower, we ask that you bring a
small dessert to pass.

**Rowing Club Board Elections:**  
Today (Nov. 16) is the last day to vote for the Spring and Fall 2016
board. If you have not already voted, please go to the link below and do
so by the end of the day today, Monday November 16.

**Practice Update:**  
There are no more practices until after the Thanksgiving break at which
point the team will move into the Erg room located in the Liberty
School. More details to come as that date approaches.

**Saline Christmas Parade:**  
HO, HO, HO!!! Similar to prior years, the Rowing team will be entering
the team trailer in the annual Saline Christmas Parade. The parade is
scheduled for Saturday, December 5 at 5:30 pm through the streets of
downtown Saline. This has been a great way to showcase and promote our
team in front of 4,000+ people along the parade route. Look for
additional information about decorating the trailer and meeting times as
the date approaches.

**Spring Break Trip:**  
If you previously expressed an interest in the team Spring Break trip
but have not paid your deposit, please do so today. We need to cancel
any unneeded rooms at the team hotel in Sarasota, Florida this week. See
the PaySchools link below to make your deposit.
