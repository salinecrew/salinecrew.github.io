Good morning rowers and parents. Here are a few rowing notes for this
week:

**Post Season Party**  
This Friday night, November 18, the rowers are having their post season
party. It will be held at Emma Frick's house, 593 E Castlebury Circle,
from 5-9pm. The rowers are asked to bring a dish to pass (below) and $5
to help the captains pay for the coaches gifts. There will be no
sleepover afterwards for both girls and boys.

-   Freshmen: Drinks
-   Sophomores: Side dish
-   Juniors: Main dish
-   Seniors: Dessert

**Banquet**  
Remember to save-the-date for Thursday, November 17 from 7-8:30 in the
High School Commons for the rowing team fall banquet. All rowers and
their families are invited to a recap and celebration of the fall
season. If you have a male rower, we ask that you bring a small
appetizer to pass. If you have a female rower, we ask that you bring a
small dessert to pass. The team will provide refreshments. Rowers,
remember to dress in your "Sunday best".

**Christmas Parade**  
The 41st annual Saline Christmas Parade is Saturday, December 3 at
5:30pm and the Rowing team will once again have an entry. This is a
great opportunity to showcase our team in front of the community and we
are looking for every rower to be involved. The rowers will be
decorating the boat trailer that Saturday and will walk with the trailer
and boats in the parade. Mark your calendars. More information to come.

**Spring Break**  
I have had lots of RSVPs from rowers and their families but I have not
yet heard from everyone. If you want to have a great family vacation in
Florida and help our team get a jump start on training for the spring
season, please send me your RSVP today. We will have an informational
meeting in December for all who are signed up.

Thanks, see you Thursday night and ROW HORNETS!!!
