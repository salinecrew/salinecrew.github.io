title: "The Great SMS Experiment Begins"
---

Many of you have asked if you can be notified by text message (SMS) instead of
email. I know this might come as a shock, but things like email and SMS cost
money when sending to groups.

Email is relatively cheap costing the club $25 per year via
<http://emaildodo.com>.

SMS is another matter. Currently, the only real cost effective option I've found
is <https://telefio.com/>. If we use the service judiciously, it runs about $10
per month.

I'm running this experiment on my own dime for now to see if it's something the
club will actually use. In addition to email and twitter, I'll send all
announcements by SMS using this service.

If you would like to participate, simply send a text message to:

**1-734-887-6769**

The message should start with the word `JOIN`, followed by a space, followed by
your name.

Example:

    to: 17348876769
    message: JOIN Mike Ward

If successful you'll receive a text message confirming your sign-up.
