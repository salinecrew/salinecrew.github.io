Saline Rowing Family,

**Practice Update:**  
Practice for the week of November 2 will be Monday - Thursday. This will
be the last week of fall practice until after Thanksgiving when we move
to the erg room in the Liberty School.

**Fall Team Banquet:**  
The team will be having a fall banquet on Wednesday, November 18 from
7-8:30 in the Saline High School Commons. This will be a time to reflect
back on the fall season and celebrate our successes. The team will
provide refreshments. If you have a male rower, we ask that you bring a
small appetizer to pass. If you have a female rower, we ask that you
bring a small dessert to pass.

**Rowing Club Board Elections:**  
I have only received a few nominations for the upcoming board elections.
The board positions are:

President  
Vice President  
Secretary  
Treasurer  
Equipment Manager  
Fundraising Chair  
Member-at-Large  
Alumni Chair

You are welcome and encouraged to nominate yourself no later than Friday
November 6. Please send your nominations to Chris Frick at
(<christopherdfrick@gmail.com>). Beginning Monday, November 9, we will
open up voting to the club and the new board will be announced at the
Fall Team Banquet.

**Spring Break Trip:**  
Once again, the trip is planned for the week of April 4-8. If you did
not sign up but are interested, please send an email to Chris Frick and
pay your deposit on the team PaySchools link below no later than

**Saline Rowing Text Messaging:**  
Saline Rowing has a text distribution service! Currently, there are
about 20 people registered. It's optional but can be handy for quick
messages.

It works similar to our email distribution. You text to the club's
number (more on that in a moment) and everyone on the distribution list
receives the text. For information on how to join the text distribution
service go to:

<http://salinerowing.org/2015/10/11/the-great-sms-experiment-begins/>

Once on the list, you can text to the following number

**1-734-887-6769**

The first word of the text message (body, not subject) must be All. The
service strips the All from your message. If you don't start your
message with All, it will only go to the list's administrator (Mike
Ward).

**An Alumni Needs Our Help:**  
Katie Stimac, a Saline Rowing Alumni and past Alumni Board Member was
recently diagnosed with leukemia. This Friday, November 6, there will be
a Marrow Donor Registry Drive at the Saline Middle School (see below for
additional details). Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers.

Have a great week and GO HORNETS!
