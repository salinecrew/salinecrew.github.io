Committee Planning:

*Cooking:* Jean Ward listed the meals for all of the regattas.

*Carpool:* Sue Stack prepared a new form. We agreed that it would be
more efficient for an adult to assign drivers and riders. We also agreed
that junior and senior drivers’ cars should be filled up first.

*Clothing:* We will ask the parents to order polo shirts if their child
is participating in the New Jersey regatta. Jennifer will check on the
availability and cost of visors.

Captain Report:

-   The captains asked that each rower buy two 7/16<sup>th</sup>
    wrenches for rigging and de-rigging.

Coaches Report:

-   8<sup>th</sup> graders cannot row spring season.

-   Spring Break: Coach Fraser was happy with the spring break training
    as well as the performance of the truck. Coach would like to see
    more coxswains at spring break training. We discussed the
    possibility of renting boats next year instead of hauling the boats
    to Florida. We will check with Kings Boat Rental next year for
    costs, etc.

-   Equipment: 

    - Coach would like 15-20 straps for the boats; mostly 9ft and 12ft straps.
    - The Fiske needs a minor repair.

    - The rowers are cleaning the boats after practice.
