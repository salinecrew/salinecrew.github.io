...

Good evening everyone,

The board has been very busy this last week. We have finalized the
purchase of a new team truck, started to make plans for The Great Gatsby
fundraiser, and have found a new clothing provider.

**Uniforms**  
The window to order team uniforms will be through Boathouse. Ordering
can begin February 20 and close March 8. I will send a link to the
webstore, soon.

**Clothing**  
The board is working on establishing a clothing webstore with
Underground Printing. It will allow families to order hats, shirts, and
misc. swag with the rowing logo on it. When the link is in place, I will
send an announcement.

**Team outing**  
The captains are planning a team ice skating event, details to come
soon.

**Winter conditioning**  
Conditioning continues to go well and will remain Monday through Friday
3:15 to 5:15, Saturday 12 to 2.
