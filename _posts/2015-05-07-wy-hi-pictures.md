Saline Rowing Parents and Team,

Here are the results from the Wy-Hi regatta on Saturday. Congratulations to
everyone on the team! We had an outstanding showing including 9 boats in the
finals with 3 first place, 2 second place and 1 third place finishes. And that
did not include boats in both the Men's and Women's Doubles finals that were
canceled where we would surly have taken home 2 more first place medals. The
team continues to get stronger each week and we are very excited about our
chances at the Grand Rapids High School Championships in 2 weeks.

It was a long day for all but we would like to offer a big THANK YOU to everyone
who helped with planning, set-up, cooking and clean-up throughout the day. Also,
thank you to the Wellings for providing the delicious Wendy's chili for the
rowers and parents!

Chris Frick
