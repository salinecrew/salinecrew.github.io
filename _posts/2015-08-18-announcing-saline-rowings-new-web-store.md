title: 'Announcing Saline Rowing's New Web Store'
---

Hello Rowers and Families!

Upon the board's approval of the new logos and the web store, we are excited to
announce the grand opening of Saline Rowing's new web store through Kings of
Merch at [hornetcountry.com](http://hornetcountry.com/) under the club tab:

[www.hornetcountry.com](http://www.hornetcountry.com/shop/category/Rowing?c=1359258&ctype=0&pn=1)

You may order anytime from this web store--no cutoffs.  We worked with the team
captains on the merchandise selections to ensure rower input :)  Kings of Merch
is generously donating about 25% of sales revenue from this web store back to
our club!

In the web store, Rower gear is labeled "CORE TEAM".  The team captains are
asking all team members to have a cap and a unisuit (novices will be given a
Saline Rowing t-shirt to wear as their uniform for their first season).  The
other CORE TEAM items are optional and are intended for rowers.  Unisuits will
continue to be ordered through JL Racing--more details on the unisuit order will
be announced soon.

> IF YOU WANT YOUR MERCHANDISE BEFORE THE FIRST REGATTA on September 19th,
> PLEASE ORDER BY AUGUST 28th.

This web store is a work-in-progress.  We welcome suggestions for additional
merchandise, colors, etc.  Please contact Jean Ward or Nicole Bergren if you
have any questions.
