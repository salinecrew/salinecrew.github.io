**Committee Planning**

*Cooking:* There will be a pre-season menu planning. Date TBD.

*Transportation:* Chris will be sending out an email posting stating
that we are looking for a carpool coordinator for the fall season. It
was suggested that maybe the captains coordinate rides to and from
practice.

**Captain Report**

-   The captains are planning a team outing for the end of the month.

-   Captains to send email to rowers to obtain volunteers to help with
    the Gatsby event.

-   We will have a rowing table to recruit new rowers at the high school
    freshman orientation, which is August 25.

-   This will be our first year participating in the high school pep
    rally, which is August 18. The captains will coordinate
    rower attendance.

-   We will have a rowing table at the high school open house, which is
    September 15 from 6:30pm-8:30pm.

**Coaches Report**

-   Fall practice start date will be September 7.

-   Fall regatta schedule:

    -   September 24 – Frogtown in Toledo

        as well. This will be a scrimmage.

    -   October 8 – Columbus Fall Classic in Columbus, OH. We will
        probably not attend this regatta. However, Matt is looking to
        have a local regatta, maybe at the Detroit Boat Club.

    -   October 22 – Head of the Charles in Boston, MA. There is a
        lottery system to get into the regatta. We hope to have a few
        boats race there.

        Chase in Traverse City, 2) Speakman in Columbus, OH, and 3) Head
        of the Eagle in Indiana. We will most likely attend the Leelanau
        Chase in Traverse City.

        may be October 15.*
