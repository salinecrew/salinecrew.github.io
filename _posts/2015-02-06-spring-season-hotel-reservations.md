title: 'Spring Season Hotel Reservation'
---
Hello Parents of Rowers,
I’m Carol Torssell, coordinator of lodging for our regattas. This is a very important message regarding making reservations ASAP, as regattas draw many teams and families along with all the other events that go on during the spring weekends. Please don’t be caught without a room. It is important to reserve your rooms as soon as possible (at no cost, just a credit card) they can always be canceled per the hotel’s cancellation policy. 

The following list will be the team hotels for regattas. By team hotel, that means hopefully the majority of the team will stay there. It’s nice for the rowers to be able to swim the night before and have an early morning breakfast (offered at NC in some hotels) before they meet at the boats. You may also book any other hotel on your own (look for discounts like AAA, AARP, etc…) At this point many hotels have only a couple of dbl Queen rooms available. 

> **Michigan State Championship Regatta, Grand Rapids held on Saturday May 16:**
> **Please reserve a room for May 15 check in and May 16 checkout**

  1. **Riverfront Hotel, 270 Ann Street NW, Grand Rapids, MI 49504   616-363-9001:**  
  There is a limited block of rooms (**15 rooms ONLY**) reserved at $139.00 with 1 king size bed and a pull out sofa under the team SALINE ROWING CLUB/TEAM. There is also only 1 room with 2 full size beds available. These rooms are held for us until April 15 and will then be released. I will assume that they will be claimed quickly as we have stayed at this hotel many times and is on the river close to the venue. There were some rooms available on booking.com, just beware some value rates are non-refundable.
 
  2. **Holiday Inn Express Grand Rapids North, 358 River Ridge Drive, Walker MI 49544   616-647-4100**  
  There is a limited block (16 rooms only) available. Five King rooms with pull out sofa ($134.00), 1 Double Queen ($124.00), and 10 King Bed only room ($109.00).  These rooms will be held until April 22nd. Click on the link below to make your reservation (block reserved under Saline Rowing Team) or call the number above to see if there are any other rooms that have become available, perhaps not under the team.

> **Western Ontario School Championships, London, Ontario, Canada,  <u style="color:red">passports required</u>, held on Saturday May 30th:
Please reserve a room for May 29 Friday check in and May 30 Sat. checkout**

*All Hotels have limited availability. Reserving a block of rooms was not an option as no one had more than a couple of rooms. I strongly urge everyone to call direct or go to Booking.com for the latest updates on hotels and room availability. Of all  the hotels I called, most had rooms with King Beds only, some with pull out sofas, and a few with 2 queen beds.*

You may opt to call the hotels directly and call often to see if a room opens up, but I wouldn’t wait too long to reserve a room. Keep in mind that some rooms may become available if previous blocks of rooms have not been claimed or canceled, and usually that would be around Apr. 29-30, in this case.

  - Hampton Inn/London   ph 1-519-649-6500
  - Staybridge Suites  ph 1-519-649-4500
  - Four Points by Sheraton/London ph 1-519-681-0600   some rooms may become available after Apr 30th.
  - Homewood Suites, Days Inn…..and more see Booking.com

> **Canadian Secondary School Rowing Championships in St Catherines / Regatta held beginning on Friday June 5 thru Sunday June 7th - <u style="color:red">passports required</u>** 

> <http://www.cssra.org>

Please note that this is for selected team members, usually the seniors and those top rowers chosen.

Not all rowers will row everyday depending on heats and finals.

> **Please reserve a hotel for June 5 Friday, June 6 Saturday and checking out on June 6 Sunday**

> **Hilton Garden Inn at Niagara-on-the-Lake, 500 York Road, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario ph 1-905-984-4200**

Coach would like to have rowers available to practice on Friday, so if you want to try and book the hotel for June 4 Thursday night, that might be a good idea. We currently have a **block of 15 rooms for 2 nights** reserved for a Canadian rate of $189.00 (at yesterday’s exchange rate it was equivalent to $151.25 US $) the rooms are held under Saline Rowing Team. If you would like to stay 1 night earlier Thursday June 5, the Can. rate is $149, these rooms are not held.

Again, like the other regattas, many blocks of rooms have already been claimed by sports teams, weddings….There are other hotels available currently with limited rooms available or you may prefer to stay closer to Niagara Falls and enjoy the sightseeing during your down time. 

I apologize for the length of this email, but I urge you to reserve your rooms, get an email confirmation, find out about their cancellation policy, use Booking.com if you like, or the hotel of your preference if you have certain loyalty membership. And if you have any questions, please email [me](mailto:catorssell@gmail.com).

As we get closer to the regatta dates, I will be sending out important information and links.

Here’s to a fabulous season!
