Saline Rowing Parents,

It has been some time since the team last had a parent social event to kick-off
the rowing season, and Kelly and I would like to bring it back. We'll call it
adult team bonding!

Saturday is our first regatta of the spring season, and while we know it will be
a long day, please consider joining us this Saturday night at our home for some
snacks and beer and wine to celebrate the start of the season as well as get to
know other parents on the team.

Beer and wine will be provided; if you'd like to bring an appetizer or snack to
share, that would be great.

Where: 593 E. Castlebury Circle, Saline (Torwood subdivison)  
When: 7-9 p.m. April 18  
RSVP: <christopherdfrick@gmail.com>
