The weather gods smiled on us and held off the storms (mostly) until we
finished. We scrimmaged with Northville and Forest Hills.

The winds came up later in the morning. That forced the last couple of races to
be run on a shorter course.

I understand Coach Matt is looking for a, "Fall Guy" to take the blame for his
being late to a family outing. Any volunteers? :)

As usual, I took some pictures and Google stitched together a short video.
