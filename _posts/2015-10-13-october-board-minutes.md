**SALINE ROWING CLUB BOARD MEETING   
SALINE DISTRICT LIBRARY  
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2015**

**PERSONS PRESENT:**

President – Chris Frick  
Vice President – Mark Eby  
Treasurer – Julie Campbell  
Equipment Manager – Cheryl Brill  
Fundraising Coordinator – Mary Hays  
Coach – Matt LeBlanc  
Food Coordinator – Jean Ward  
Captains – Matt Eby, Jenna Jansa  

**MINUTES OF SEPTEMBER 1, 2015 BOARD MEETING:** The minutes of the
September 2015 Board Meeting have been posted online. No changes were
requested, so those minutes are considered approved.

**COMMITTEE PLANNING:** Jean Ward reported that food for rowers was
adequate at Frog Town. Cheryl Brill noted that the food buyers need to
purchase more Gatorade, water and snacks for regattas, as the Club ran
short of those items at Frog Town.

**TRANSPORTATION:** Judy Inge has added a second night of lodging at the
Country Inn and Suites in Traverse City, for the Leelenau Regatta.

**CAPTAINS REPORT:** The Captains are planning a team bonding event on
Thursday, October 22, at the Talladay Farms Corn Maze. They will
encourage all novices to attend that event.

**COACH’S REPORT:** There are more than 20 novice rowers participating
in fall rowing. The total team count is now close to 60. Novices will be
rowing at the Lansing Regatta.

Since the move to the new boat house, the team has had more time to
practice on the water. The team has had several good practices within
the last two weeks, with the return of good weather.

The coaches used a barge for the purpose of novice training.

The new boat trailer is due for delivery on approximately October 16.
New oars were ordered in September and are scheduled for delivery soon.

The team is not going to row at the Indianapolis Regatta on October 31,
2015.

**TREASURER REPORT:** Julie Campbell reviewed the financial reports for
September 30, 2015. She noted that some rower families have not paid
their fall dues. She will be invoicing novice rower families during
October.

Julie reported that Club finances are generally in good shape. She noted
that the Club still needs to pay the remainder of the trailer purchase
price (approximately $10,000.00), and for the new oars and Fall coaches’
salaries. She expects the Club to have a small surplus of funds after
paying those expenses.

**EQUIPMENT MANAGER REPORT:** Cheryl Brill reported that the Club needs
to replace several small items of equipment in the trailer, including a
food cooler, 2-3 water jugs and tie-straps for use in securing equipment
when the trailer is moved. She noted that the Club may be able to
recycle older tie-straps from the boat trailer when the coaches purchase
new tie-straps for that use. The Board determined by consensus that
Cheryl has authority to spend less than $100.00 per item on replacing
equipment that is regularly used by the Club. She may submit her
receipts for those purchases to the Treasurer for reimbursement.

The Club presently owns approximately 23 erg machines. With the increase
in rower count, the Club will need to purchase 7-10 more erg machines
for use during winter training.

Coach Matt stated that his equipment wish list includes the purchase of
a pontoon boat and possibly a 5<sup>th</sup> Coaches’ launch. He
discussed the availability of a used pontoon boat that has been
well-maintained, for a price of $2,600.00. The owner of that boat is
Coach Matt’s uncle. Coach Matt confirmed that the boat has been
well-maintained and is in good shape. He noted that a pontoon boat will
be very useful to the Club, especially when setting buoy lines and other
regatta course equipment. Following that discussion and upon a motion by
Julie Campbell and a second by Mark Eby, the Board passed a resolution
authorizing Coach Matt to act on behalf of the Club in purchasing that
pontoon boat for use by the Club.

**FUNDRAISING UPDATE:** Mary Hays led a general discussion regarding
fundraising opportunities. No fundraising activities are currently
underway, except for the ongoing Busch’s card fund raiser.

**GENERAL AGENDA ITEMS:**

1.  Chris Frick provided an update on the planning for the 2016 spring
    break trip. He has confirmed the availability of a training course
    in the Sarasota, Florida area for the week of April 3-8, 2016. He is
    looking into making arrangements for lodging and other activities
    during that week. He will provide more information as he gathers it.

2.  The end of season banquet for the Fall season will be held during
    the week of November 12-19. Boys will be responsible for appetizers;
    Girls will be responsible for desserts. The team will provide drinks
    and tableware.
