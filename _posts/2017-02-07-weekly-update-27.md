Good evening rowing families,

**ERG for sale**  
One of our rowing families is selling an ERG – please see below

My daughter Rachel Weidmayer has an erg she is no longer using, and
would like to sell. We were wondering if any of your current rowers
would be interested. Please feel free to have them contact me if
interested. We will give them a great deal! $150. Monitor on it works.
It is an older model that was purchased from the Saline crew team when
the current ergs were purchased.

Thanks Renee <Rweidmayer67@gmail.com>

**Winter conditioning**  
Practice will continue to be: Monday through Friday 3:15 to 5:15 and
Saturday 12 to 2PM

**Spring Break**  
The pay-school web store site has been updated so that those families
that are attending spring break can now pay the $150 rower fee. Please
use the link:
<https://saline.revtrak.net/tek9.asp?pg=products&specific=jnprcoe0>. The
rower fee payment is due Feb 28. If you have questions or are still
undecided, please contact me.

**Great Gatsby Fundraiser planning**  
Preparations are beginning now for the team fundraiser. Our first
meeting will be February 9 at the Saline Library. This meeting is open
to everyone. If you interested in helping, please plan to attend. Topics
to be discussed include: donation request letters, sponsorship
information, auction item information, and general information.

**Rower Meeting – Returning and New**  
There is a mandatory meeting for all returning and new rowers before the
Spring 2017 season. February 23, Liberty school, 7PM.

GO HORNETS!

Bill Christen
