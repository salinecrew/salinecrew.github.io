The #2 question I get about the website is, "How do I upload my pictures to the website?"

And the answer is, "You don't! (at least not directly)"
 
Use one of the free photo websites to upload your pictures. I bet many of you are already doing this with your own photos for backup. Send me a link and I'll get them on the website.

If you are looking for a recommendation, I use <http://imgur.com>. It's totally free and they leave you alone. No begging for upgrades or spam emails (at least in my experience). Imgur also has an excellent album viewer that works nicely on our site. (see <https://salinecrew.github.io/2015/03/11/gatsby-fund-raiser-pictures/> for an example).

Flicker, Picassa, Dropbox and One Drive are all good choices. Just about anything works now a days.

You can also just email me the photos (<{{ site.data.members.webmaster-email }}>). I can upload them, but I'll think less of you for it (kidding).

Tips:

  - Only send me the photos you want displayed. Remove the blurry ones and repeats and make sure they're in order you want them. I generally don't filter or editorialize unless it's really obvious the picture does not belong.
  - Don't shot-gun us with every photo. Two dozen photos are nice. 120 photos might be overwhelming.
  - Do include a paragraph or two about the event/photos. Photos without context are not nearly as fun!
