...

I hope everyone had a great weekend. Thank you to everyone who helped
out with the first alumni row on Sunday. We had over 25 of our alumni
come check out the new boathouse and reconnect with old friends. This
was a great start to what we hope will become an annual event.

Here are some notes for this week:

**Practice**  
The team practice schedule is Monday - Thursday at the boathouse on Ford
Lake. Thursday will be a little longer as the team will load the boats
on the trailer for the regatta this weekend.

**Regatta**  
This week we race on Saturday, October 8, in the Head of the Grand on
the Grand River in Lansing, MI. Details to come out later this week.

**Regatta Meals**  
The link on the team website for the Saline Schools Web Store is now
accepting payments for parent and guest meals at our regattas. The cost
is $10 for adults and $5 for children. Orders must be placed by the
end of day on the Tuesday before a race so that our volunteers have time
to plan and shop for food for the upcoming week. Here is a direct link:

**Regatta Volunteers**  
The Volunteer Sign-up link is now up and running on the team website.
Remember, it takes help from everyone involved to make our regattas run
smooth and efficient. Sign up today!

HORNETS!!!
