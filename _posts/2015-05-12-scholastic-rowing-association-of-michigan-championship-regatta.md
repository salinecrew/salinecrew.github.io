While the kids did not have practice yesterday, they will be training hard this
week. Barring any weather related issues, they will be practicing as usual
Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday they will get their final workout in for the
races and then be de-rigging and loading the boat trailers so practice will most
likely be longer than normal. There is no practice Friday as this is a travel
day. More information on report times, race times and venue information will be
sent out later this week as that information becomes available.

The venue this weekend will be set up a little different from years past. The
biggest change will be where the food trailers and tents are allowed to be set
up. Given the large number of teams that will be there, this will be a
challenge. 

Randy Brill has generously volunteered his time again to get the
trailer there Friday but we need help from anyone in town to navigate the new
venue rules and stake out our claim on the open space. He will be at the site
around 7:00 pm on Friday. If anyone is in town that evening, we are asking that
you please head down to Riverside Park and help the team get set up. Please let
myself or Randy know when you can be there.

Thank you to everyone who has and will be volunteering. Your contributions are
invaluable and truly appreciated by the team.

See you bright and early Saturday morning and GO HORNETS!

### Information and Map From the Race Organizers

Riverside Park  
North Monroe  
Grand Rapids, Michigan

**Friday, May 15**  
The park will be ready for boat trailers and team tents on Friday at 2:00 pm -
7:00pm The gates will be locked for the night at 10:00 pm per the city.

**Saturday, May 16**  
Park gates will open at 7:00 am for boat trailers, buses, and team supply
trailers ONLY. Parking for athletes, parents, etc. will be open at 7:30.

**Team Tents**  
All Team tents must be place in the large grass area directly to the south of
the main access road going into the park. No team tents will be place north of
the pond bridge.

**Parking**  
Trailers may unload from **THE MAIN DRIVE** next to the staging area. (See map
below). They must me moved north, **PAST** the yellow gate and backed onto the
lawn area. both sides may be used.

Tow vehicles will be parked in the parking spaces at the Island Shelter, just
south of the yellow gate.

Parking for Team trailers (tents, supplies, and food) must be placed in the
parking area along side the main access road across from the team tent area.
Tell your group to get there and place their trailer on Friday or between 6:00am
and 6:45 and they won't have any problem. They are not allowed on the grass area
(due to rain) or where the Buses will be parked for any reason per the city.
Please tell your group they will not be allowed to "drop off".

**Automobiles**  
As you all know, parking is always tight. There will be a limited number of
spaces for cars north of the yellow gates, but it is limited. There are also
spaces in the parking lot directly to the right when as soon as you enter the
park. Additionally cars can be parked on Monroe Ave on the shoulder.

There is a large parking lot at the north end of the park. Use the entrance
north of Boat launch 2. All students and athletes MUST use this lot. It is only
a short walk.

**Drop off**  
All students must be dropped off in the circular turn around at the end of the
main access road.  
We will of course make special arrangements for handicapped drop off and
parking. Cars must have a handicap plate or card to park in our designated
areas.

**Trash**  
With all the athletes and food we generate a lot of trash. A larger dumpster
will be place near the Team area. **IT IS EVERY TEAM'S RESPONSIBILITY TO
COLLECT, BAG, AND TRANSPORT ALL YOUR TRASH TO THE DUMPSTER**. Placing by your
tent area is not acceptable. We have limited staff this year and the city will
levy a $500 fine if the park is not cleaned throughly. I understand your parents
are tired and want to get on road, but this simply must be done.

Thank you for your cooperation.
