I hope everyone enjoyed a safe and happy Thanksgiving weekend as well as
the short break from rowing. I only have a few things to report this
week.

**Winter Erg Workouts**  
Practice resumes this week in the erg room in Liberty School. The
schedule until Christmas break will be Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays
from 3-5. The team will meet right after school where they did all fall
for carpooling over to Liberty. Parent pickup will be at 5:00 in the
parking lot on the south end of Liberty School.

**Saline Christmas Parade**  
The team will be participating in Saline Christmas Parade this Saturday
night. Decorating the boat trailer will take place Saturday morning
(place and time to be announced later this week) and the rowers will
meet later that afternoon to walk in the parade.

**This Tuesday ONLY at the Boathouse**  
The team will need the rowers to meet at the boathouse after school this
Tuesday ONLY to load boats on the trailer for the parade. Meet in the
carpool lot right after school.

Thanks and see you at the parade Saturday!

Chris Frick
