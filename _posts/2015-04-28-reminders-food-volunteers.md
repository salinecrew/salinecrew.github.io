Just a quick reminder that if you plan on eating at the regatta this Saturday,
you need to place your order through Pay Schools by 8:00 pm tonight.

Also, there are still lots of spots open to volunteer to help the team this
weekend. Please check the sign up genius on the team site and volunteer today.
