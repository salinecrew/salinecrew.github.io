Happy Halloween everyone! The Leelanau Chase was a great end to the fall
season. Lots of fall colors and even more medals for the team.
Congratulations to all of the rowers who medaled yesterday! And thank
you to everyone who helped with food, set up and clean up. Things went
smoothly and we were able to get out of there before 3:30!

Things are starting to wind down on the water but we still have lots in
store before winter hits.

**Practice**  
This will be the team's final practice on the water this fall. Practice
is Tuesday - Thursday. Novices will start learning to scull and varsity
rowers will have chance to row in new combinations of boats. On
Thursday, the team will pack the boats away for the winter.

**Rowing Club Board Elections**  
There is still time to put your "name in the hat" for the Spring and
Fall 2017 board. I have heard from a few people but the club still needs
more names to fill out the board for next year. The board positions are:

-   President
-   Vice President
-   Secretary
-   Treasurer
-   Equipment Manager
-   Fundraising Chair
-   Member-at-Large
-   Alumni Chair

This is a great way to get involved and help shape the future of the
club you and your kids love so much. Novice parents, you are the future
of the club so please consider putting your name in the hat! If you have
any specific questions about the board, please send Chris Frick an email
(<christopherdfrick@gmail.com>) or catch me at the race this weekend. We
need nominations for these positions no later than Friday, November 4.
After that time, we will open up voting to the club and the new board
will be announced at the Fall Team Banquet (date and time coming soon).

**Fall Banquet**  
Just a heads up that the team will be having a banquet to celebrate the
successes of the fall season. The board will be meeting tomorrow night
to start planning. I will send out a reminder and details as soon as the
date is set.

**Spring Break**  
Remember to send me a quick email if you and your rower plan on joining
the team for its spring break training trip next April 3-7, 2017 in
Sarasota, Florida . The team needs a minimum of 20 rowers to schedule
the trip. If you are interested, we need to have a formal commitment
emailed to me December 1. A payment section will be set up on the school
web store soon. After December 1, we will schedule a parents and rower
meeting for those who are signed up to discuss further details.

Thank you to everyone who helped this fall. It was great to see so many
new faces get involved. GO HORNETS!

Chris Frick
