I found out last night at the board meeting there's a much easier way to manage
signups for volunteering at the regattas. It's called, "Signup Genius". Seems
like everyone but me knows about this wonderful service.

I've had reports that some are having difficultly with the shared Google
Spreadsheet so I'm scraping it and using this new service. Unfortunately, that
means you get to signup again. Sorry about that.

I think you'll agree this is the better way to go.

For reference, here's a link to the spreadsheet to remind yourself what you
signed up for earlier. I've also updated the links in the earlier, "Parents
PULL" post.
