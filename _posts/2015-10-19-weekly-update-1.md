**<ins>Leelanau Chase Regatta:</ins>**  
We will be racing this SUNDAY in the Leelanau Chase on Lake Leelanau.  Report
times and lineups will come out later this week.  Remember that the regatta is
at the Fountain Point Resort, about 30 minutes north of the hotels. Plan
accordingly when leaving Sunday morning.  See below for directions and parking
maps:

**<ins>Regatta Food for Families:</ins>**  
Please go to the Payschools link on the team site (link below) to sign
up before 10 PM Tuesday.  I would recommend taking advantage of the food that we
prepare as food options near the regatta are non-existent.

**<ins>Spring Break Rowing Trip:</ins>**  
The team is planning on a non-mandatory spring break rowing trip to Sarasota,
Florida.  Cheryl Brill and I plan on having a short meeting at the right after
we get set up on Sunday morning to go over travel information and answer any
questions. 

**<ins>Family Rower Pictures:</ins>**  
We are still missing many of the family pictures and profiles for the web site. 
Please send a picture and brief rower profile to Mike Ward to update the Saline
Rowing Families link of the site.  Mike's email is <mike@wardfam.org>. See the
link below to see other families profiles.  It's easy and a fun way to
embarrass, I mean, highlight your rower and their family.
