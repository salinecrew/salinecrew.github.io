### CALLING ALL CREW PARENT VOLUNTEERS!

Regatta food is a huge undertaking, and while it requires many volunteers, I
would like to point out some of the benefits it provides for rowers, as well as
crew parents / families. The “Food Tent” is much like a tailgate, thus a
gathering place for crew parents / families to socialize. Most importantly, it
is a place for rowers to “fuel-up” on healthier food items that may not
otherwise be available. Additionally, Regatta venues are often in remote areas
and therefore other options may not be convenient.

Volunteer sign-up for each Regatta venue, [Regatta Volunteer
