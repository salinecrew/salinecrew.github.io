...

Congratulations to the men's and women's V8 boats who competed in Boston
last weekend. The entire club is proud of the way you represented our
team. Now we move on the the final regatta of the fall season, the
Leelanau Chase. Here are the rowing notes for this week:

**Practice**  
Practice this week will be Tuesday - Thursday. The practice Thursday my
run a little long as the team will be loading the boat trailer for the
regatta this Sunday in Leelanau. Next week, we will have practice
Tuesday - Thursday (Nov 1-3). Novices will begin working on sculling for
the Spring season, varsity rowers will get a chance to row in boats of
their choice and that Thursday the team will pack up the boats for the
winter.

**Regatta**  
This weekend is the final regatta of the fall season, the Leelanua
Chase. Remember that racing is on Sunday, October 30. For those who have
not been to this regatta, it is in one of the most picturesque settings
we race in all year. But remember it is also northern Michigan so please
pack for ANY kind of weather (sun, rain, snow). Below is a link to the
race on Regatta Central. More information will come out later this week
with lineups and directions.

**Spring Break**  
As the weather starts to turn this fall, there is no better time to
start thinking of the warm beaches in Florida. Remember to RSVP soon for
your spot on the team spring break training trip in Sarasota, FL next
April 3-7, 2017. This is a non-mandatory event but is a way for our team
to get a jump start on training for the spring season and get ahead of
our competition. As mentioned last week, we will be using the World
Class Rowing & Aquatic Sports Center (<http://www.worldclassrowing.com>)
for our training. This site is used for US National training and tryouts
in addition to hosting the 2017 World Championships. We will be at the
Nathan Benderson Park on their 2000 meter fully-laned courses.

Additional info:

-   This is a family-style trip, meaning it is intended for rowers and
    their families to make the trip
-   We need at least 20 rowers to participate to make it work
-   Rowers will participate in twice daily training and practice
    supervised by Saline Rowing coaches
-   The cost for site access and transportation of our boats to Florida
    will be approximately $150 per rower (based on 20 rowers)
-   Travel, hotel, meals and extra-curricular costs are the
    responsibility of each family
-   We are once again working Homewood Suites in Sarasota, where the
    team stayed last year, to secure a block of rooms at a group rate,
    however, you are free to stay anywhere you choose I will hold a
    brief Q&A session about the trip after we set up and feed the rowers
    breakfast in Leelanau on Sunday. If you are interested, we need to
    have a formal commitment emailed to me December
-   A payment section will be set up on the school web store soon. After
    December 1, we will schedule a parents and rower meeting for those
    who are signed up to discuss further details.

**Rowing Club Board Elections**  
At the conclusion of each fall season, the team elects a new board of
directors to serve the Spring and following Fall rowing seasons. The
board positions are:

-   President
-   Vice President
-   Secretary
-   Treasurer
-   Equipment Manager
-   Fundraising Chair
-   Member-at-Large
-   Alumni Chair

This is a great way to get involved and help shape the future of the
club you and your kids love so much. **Novice parents**, you are the
future of the club so please consider putting your name in the hat! If
you have any specific questions about the board, please send Chris Frick
an email (<christopherdfrick@gmail.com>) or catch me at the race this
weekend. We need nominations for these positions no later than Friday,
November 4. After that time, we will open up voting to the club and the
new board will be announced at the Fall Team Banquet (date and time
coming soon).

Have a great week and GO HORNETS!!!
