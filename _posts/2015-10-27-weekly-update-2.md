Saline Rowing Family,

It was a great final regatta for the fall season.  On top of the wonder
fall weather and colorful setting, we took home 8 medals and had several
boats finish in the top 5\.  Great job rowers and coaches\!

**Practice Update:**\
Practice for the next few weeks will be on
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday only at the lake (weather
permitting).  If the weather is bad, look for emails during the day
notifying you of a change in the practice location or cancellation. 
After that, we be moving to the erg room located in the Liberty School
for the remainder of the fall and winter.

**Fall Team Banquet:**\
The team will be having a fall banquet on Wednesday, November
18 from 7-8:30 in the Saline High School Commons.  This will be a time
to reflect back on the fall season and celebrate our successes.  The
team will provide refreshments.  If you have a male rower, we ask that
you bring a small appetizer to pass.  If you have a female rower, we ask
that you bring a small dessert to pass.

**Rowing Club Board Elections:**\
At the conclusion of each fall season, the team elects a new board of
directors to serve the Spring and following fall rowing seasons.  The
board positions are:  

     President\
     Vice President\
     Secretary\
     Treasurer\

positions no later than Friday, November 6\.  After that time, we will
open up voting to the club and the new board will be announced at the
Fall Team Banquet.

**Spring Break Trip:**\

Leelanau and had a great response.  Once again, the trip is planned for
