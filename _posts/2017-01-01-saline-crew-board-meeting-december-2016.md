Committee Planning:

information.

*Cooking/Food Supply:* The food committee needs another volunteer, as
Bill Christen is bowing out since he is now the board president.

*Transportation:* Judy Inge and Sue Stack are heading this up.

Captain Report:

-   The captains are planning an ice skating party in January or
    February.

-   The captains will continue to inform the food committee regarding
    what the team likes.

-   The team may do some cross training at Cross Fit Gym.

Coaches Report:

-   Winter conditioning is going well. 25-30 kids are participating.

-   Coach Fraser would like seat pads on ergs for each rower. We could
    buy the material and make our own. Coach Fraser would also like
    slides, kettle balls and bands.

-   Starting in Spring season, Coach Fraser would like to add a morning
    practice before school, 2-3 times a week, at Liberty, for varsity
    only. This extra practice for varsity will most likely be mandatory.

-   Coach Fraser is very interested in hosting a Salt Springs Regatta in
    the Spring season.

-   Coach is also interested in possibly participating in erg races.

-   Coach will email the president and treasurer his equipment requests
    to facilitate ordering. Julie Campbell can order the equipment.

Equipment:

-   The team needs a pick-up truck to pull the boat trailer. Briarwood
    Ford has agreed to work with us if want. Greg Schreiber has taken
    the lead on this. We need to find out if the school will finance
    half the cost of the truck and let the club pay them back.

-   Coach Fraser only wants to buy new boats going forward. Boats are
    considered “old” after 10 years.

-   In two years, the team will need a new 8 boat.

-   Two boats were recently painted at Scott’s Auto Collision.

Fundraising/Special Events:

-   We will do the Oscar’s fundraiser again in the Spring. We need more
    advertising for this fundraiser.

-   The first Great Gatsby meeting will be in February.

General Agenda Items:

-   Spring Break: The first meeting will be January 10<sup>th</sup> at
    the Brills house.

-   The board discussed the Canadian regatta.

-   Spring Home Regatta: It may be on May 13<sup>th</sup>. We need to
    get the township involved as soon as possible. We also need to start
    getting committee volunteers.

-   The returning rower meeting will probably be held at the end of
    February.
