Saline Rowing Family,

**Practice Update:**  
There are no more practices until after the Thanksgiving break at which
point the team will move into the Erg room located in the Liberty
School. More details to come as that date approaches.

**Rowing Club Board Elections:**  
Later today, an email will be sent to the Rowing parents with
information about the club board elections and a link to voting. Please
check your email and let me know if you did not receive the email and
link.

**Fall Team Banquet:**  
Just a reminder that the fall banquet is on Wednesday, November 18 from
7-8:30 in the Saline High School Commons. The team will provide
refreshments. If you have a male rower, we ask that you bring a small
appetizer to pass. If you have a female rower, we ask that you bring a
small dessert to pass.

**Spring Break Trip:**  
Today is the last day to pay your deposit for the Spring Break trip,
scheduled for the week of April 4-8. Don't be left out! If you did not
sign up but are interested, please send an email to Chris Frick. See the
PaySchools link below to make your deposit.

**Saline Rowing Text Messaging:**  
Saline Rowing has a text distribution service! It works similar to our
email distribution. You text to the club's number and everyone on the
distribution list receives the text. For information on how to join the
text distribution service go to:

<http://salinerowing.org/2015/10/11/the-great-sms-experiment-begins/>

Once on the list, you can text to the following number (1-734-887-6769).
The first word of the text message (body, not subject) must be All. The
service strips the All from your message. If you don't start your
message with All, it will only go to the list's administrator (Mike
Ward).

Thanks again to everyone for a great fall season and GO HORNETS!

Chris Frick
