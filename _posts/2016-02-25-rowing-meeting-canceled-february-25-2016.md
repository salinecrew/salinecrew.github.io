Due to the weather, the mandatory, "Returning Rower Meeting" is canceled
for February 25, 2016. We'll announce the rescheduled time shortly.

URGENT
------

The Saline HS team store for unisuits is now open. At the JL Team Store
site, you can use your own credit card to order required team unisuit as
well as training gear (the unisuit at JL Racing and the white cap on
[hornetcountry.com]({{site.data.links.hornet-country}}) are the
only 2 required team items). Bulk shipping and handling for order placed
on JL Racing will be calculated on the checkout page.

For order through JL Racing, everyone MUST get their order in by
**midnight (PST) on March 7th**. If you miss the store closing date, you
will need to order your uniform as an individual, directly from JL. For
individual orders, pricing and shipping will be different than a team
purchase.
