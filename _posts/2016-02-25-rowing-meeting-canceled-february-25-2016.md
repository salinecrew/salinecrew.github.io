Due to the weather, the mandatory, "Returning Rower Meeting" is canceled
for February 25, 2016. We'll announce the rescheduled time shortly.

URGENT
------

Since there's no Spring rower meeting tonight, you need to know about
this ASAP...

There are only 2 required team uniform items 

1. The unisuit at JL Racing
2. the white cap through Kings of Merch at [hornet country]({{site.data.links.hornet-country}}).

The Saline HS team store for unisuits through JL Racing is now open. At
the JL Team Store site, you can use your own credit card to order
required team unisuit as well as training gear. Bulk shipping and
handling for orders placed on JL Racing will be calculated on the
checkout page.

For orders through JL Racing, everyone MUST get their order in by
**midnight (PST) on March 7th**. If you miss the store closing date, you
will need to order your uniform as an individual, directly from JL. For
individual orders, pricing and shipping will be different than a team
purchase.

There is information on the site to help you place your order. Click on
