It was another strong showing from our rowing team at weather-shortened
Wy-Hi regatta this past weekend. Results are not in yet for the events
that were completed but I will share them as soon as possible. Thank you
everyone who helped last weekend and thank you for your patience during
the long day. As they say, the only certain thing in rowing is the
uncertainty of the weather.

**Practice**  
Practice this week is Monday - Friday at our Ford Lake boathouse.

**Regatta**  
This week our team is hosting 6 other teams for the 2nd Annual Salt
Springs Sprints. The first race is scheduled to start at 8:00 am and
events will run through approximately 2:00 pm. This regatta will be
different for our parents and volunteers in 2 ways. First, the teams and
rowers will be stationed at our boathouse on Ford Lake but spectators
will be located about 1/2 mile away at Ford Lake Park. Second, we are
asking all Saline Rowing parents to volunteer to help run the regatta.
See below for information on Regatta Volunteers. More information will
come out later this week with report times, volunteer reminders and
other race day information.

**No Parent Food This Week**  
Since our club is hosting the regatta, there will not be any Saline
parent/spectator food options. It will be a long day from pre-race setup
through post-race cleanup, so we encourage all Saline volunteers and
spectators to bring their own snacks, lunch and water for the day.

**Rower Food**  
There will be food at the boathouse for the rowers consisting of a
continental breakfast, snacks and a pizza lunch along with beverages for
the day. We will not have the grill and cook top burners set up like we
traditionally do for a regatta.

**Regatta Volunteers**  
As we have all seen at other events, hosting a regatta is no small
undertaking. We need help from EVERYONE this weekend to make our event
run as smoothly as possible for the rowers and guests. There is a link
on the team site (below) for volunteer signup. Please sign up as soon as
possible. If you have questions on volunteering, please email [Mike
Ward](mailto:mike@wardfam.org) who is our regatta chair. Cheryl Brill
will be coordinating volunteers on the day of the event to ensure we
have enough help in the right places during the day. Look for updates
later in the week on volunteer report times and places.

**Promote the Salt Springs Sprints!**  
Sue Stack has coordinated with the High School and Saline Post to
promote our event. Thank you Sue! This event is a great chance to
showcase our team and the sport to our community. I have attached the
flyer that was put up around the school and the race logo. Feel free to
share this on social media and ask your friends and neighbors to come
check out the team and races.

Thanks again for everyone's help. See you again Saturday morning and GO
HORNETS!
