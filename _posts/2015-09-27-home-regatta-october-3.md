We're having a Regatta on Ford Lake this Saturday.

In Summary

Spectator Viewing
-----------------

Spectators can view the Regatta from **Ford Lake Park** (not Ford Lake Heritage
Park and not Lakeside Park). Ford Lake Park is on Huron River Dr.

There may be a fee to enter the park (usually $3). It is usually not collected
this time of year.

There will be signs posted but they're small. It's best to check a map and plan
ahead.

There will be attendants to direct you to the parking area.

Boat House
----------

The boat house is located at Lakeside Park. Lakeside Park is on Textile Rd.

There is no parking available at the boat house with the exception of the boat
trailers and support vehicles. Plan on dropping your rowers off at the boat
house and then proceeding to the Ford Lake Park.
