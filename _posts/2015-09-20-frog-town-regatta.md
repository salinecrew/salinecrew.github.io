The Regatta Central Web site has [detailed
directions](https://www.regattacentral.com/regatta/directions.jsp?job_id=3933&org_id=0).

Don't forget to volunteer. **We really need everyone to pitch in**. To sign up,
go to [Signup Genius](http://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f0a4dafab2ba2f49-2015).

Also, I'm pretty sure we have more than 9 families participating this year. Send
me your family photos/bios now! (<mike@wardfam.org>)

Even if your rower is not eligible to race consider attending. The first race of
the year is always, shall we say, entertaining.

Coach Matt will notify us later in the week as to what time your rower needs to
be at the site.

Go Hornets!
