Hats off to our Senior Men's 8 making the finals! Official results can be found
[here](file:///C:/Users/Mike/Downloads/2015%20CSSRA%20Sunday%20Final%20Results.pdf)

This was my first year at CSSRA. It's a great venue and wonderful setting. I do
think next year I'll try to organize some after event activities at the local
watering holes now that I know what's what.

We didn't get to see the starts from where we were positioned. There different
in that the boats are held in position from a fixed dock. This
[video](https://youtu.be/O3-bZFBmbVc) shows how it's done.

And of course, there's my usual [video](<https://youtu.be/ft0MwbWXg9s>) montage.

It will likely take me another 3 days to get caught up on sleep.
