title: "March Board Meeting Notes"
---
On Tuesday, the Crew Board held the March meeting.  While this is a relatively slow period for the team and Board there were a few things discussed.  Here are the highlights:

 - We are in the final stages of updating the Saline Crew website.  We plan to be a lot more active on posting news, stories and pictures once the updates are complete.  I will be sending out a separate email when it is ready and encourage all rowers and parents to actively use the site for everything Saline Crew.

 - I will be sending out a communication to everyone on our membership list and asking you to notify me of any changes in rower and parent information.  Current membership information is key to keeping everyone informed and active with the team.

 - The team has also started a Twitter account.  If you use Twitter, I encourage you to follow the team at **@Saline_Rowing**.

 - Great Gatsby planning is in full swing.  We had a great turnout at our last meeting but are still looking for more people to get involved.  Our next meeting is Wednesday, March 25 at 7:30 in the Saline Library.  This is a great way to make an impact on the future of the team and to meet other Crew parents.

 - Just another reminder that Spring Season fees are due by March 16.  You are encouraged to pay them online at <https://www.payschools.com/cat.asp?id=C740BA23A6504DACBD07791491B63467>. If you have any questions about your dues, please contact Chris Frick at <christopherdfrick@gmail.com> or Julie Campbell at <julie.campbell@hotmail.com>.

 - Finally, my wife, Kelly Frick, and I will be hosting a parent social night at our house in April.  This will be a night to get together as team parents for fun and a few lively beverages.  More to come soon.

Thanks and letâ€™s hope for continued warm weather.

Chris Frick, President
