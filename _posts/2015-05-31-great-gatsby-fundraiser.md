We need your help securing the items our guests will be bidding on at the
auction. So we have put together a [Business List (Signup
Genius)](http://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f0a4dafab2ba2f49-donor) sheet as we do
not want to "double dip" any of the local businesses. If you are unsure how to
contact a business for an auction donation, please feel free to contact me,
Stacy **734-649-6989**. I will give you a run down of how it works. Many of
these businesses have donated in the past, so the lines of donations already
exist.

These are only suggestions of businesses that have donated in the past or
hopefully in the future.  Feel free to contact a business that is not on the
list too.  Nothing is too small of a donation, we will "bundle" things to make
baskets/packages. for the smaller items.  We would love to get a boat or bike -
maybe a sporting goods store would be able to donate something, REI, Dunhams,
Walmart, Meijer, Dick's, Performance Bike, Target...  I have learned that to get
a larger item donated or when trying to get a donation from a larger company
that they need more time - so now is good to start asking. 

Maybe your employer or a business will match our profits; maybe you know a
business that would like to sponsor the event.  All the forms you need to
approach a business for a donation or a sponsorship are on the website. 

With every donation I will need a Commitment Form filled out (also on the
website) I need this **completely filled out** so that we can get the *Thank
You* letter correct and I need it for an accurate starting bid amount.

I know that money is tight for many companies. Let them know that we will
display any advertising they will give us (we will return anything they want
back) we will display any marketing info., business cards, coupons, fliers, etc.

From this day forward (until 08-17) keep the auction in mind. Keep some
commitment letters and business letters on hand. You will soon discover how many
things you can get from the businesses you frequent.

Please do not hesitate to call me if you feel you have no idea how to get this
party started, I can help you with that!

Think BIG, but nothing is too small and everything is appreciated.
