*From the Great Gatsby Fundraiser*

The Saline Crew team is a club sport. All of the team's expenses are raised
either through dues or fund raising efforts. The team requires help from all of
the Saline Rowing Community.

We have three levels of fund raising.

1.  Team fund raising for operating expenses and equipment 
2.  Individual fund raising for rowers
3.  Capital campaign - boathouse

Why do we need a Boathouse?
---------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[![concept](/assets/images/lakeside-park.jpg)](/assets/forms/lakeside-park-improvements-concept-plan.pdf)  
 *Concept Plan*

A crew program requires access to water, interested students, and a talented
coaching staff. In order to continue to provide this sport to the 50+ high
school athletes that currently participate, it is essential to create a more
permanent home for the 12 boats and equipment that the team has purchased and
that are insured by Saline Schools. The community boathouse that would have
usage for students and adults that are interested in a lifetime sport.

### A little background history:

The Saline High School Crew program, a division of the Community Education
Program, was founded in 2004 and currently rows on Ford Lake, with water access
provided by Lakeshore Apartments in Ypsilanti Township. The boats, trailers, and
other equipment are stored in a fenced-in storage area located in another part
of the apartment complex during the fall and spring seasons of rowing. In the
winter and summer, the boats are stored outdoors adjacent to the school bus
parking lots.

The team has invested over $150,000 in boats and a hauling trailer. The team has
an annual budget of over $60,000.

The EMU womens’ rowing team is also interested in the construction of a
boathouse as the team currently store their boats on a public parking lot in the
park during the rowing season. The Ypsilanti Township Master Plan has provided
for construction of a Boathouse along the south shore of Ford Lake, adjacent to
Ford Lake Park. As EMU has standing in Ypsilanti Township, the parent-run High
School Crew board is currently developing a plan to provide for joint
construction of a boathouse with the EMU program.

### Why expand the existing program:

The current Saline High School Crew program serves approximately 50 High School
athletes and is in its 6th year. The team initially drove to the Irish Hills in
Lenawee County to row on Sand Lake. The Crew parent board negotiated to row on
Ford Lake, accessing the water from Lakeshore Apartments in Ypsilanti Township
for the past 2 years. 2 SAS teachers, Bridgette Sparks and Dave Fiske, coach the
team during the fall and spring seasons. Alumni coaches assist the teams during
portions of the season.

The team is self-funded (parent-funded loans, donations, and seasonal fees have
paid for 12 boats, a hauling trailer, 2 launches & outboard motors, and other
coaching equipment). The equipment is insured through Saline Area Schools,
(SAS), and is listed as an SAS asset. A Community boathouse for Saline Area
athletes would improve the recreational and competitive opportunities for
students and also continue to encourage an appreciation for area waterways.

The Eastern Michigan University (EMU) Women’s Crew program currently stores
their rowing boats when in-season in the parking lot of Ypsilanti Township Ford
Lake Park. Ypsilanti Township Master Plan provides for the creation of a
community Boathouse to serve local residents. EMU has a historic relationship
with the township and has expressed the desire to partner with Saline Crew in
the building of a boathouse.

A Community boathouse that serves the Saline community (and adjacent community
programs that participate in the funding process) would increase participation
in rowing at Saline High School & Middle School programs and increase adult
participation in rowing events, provide local instructional activities like
‘Learn to Row’ and community outreach events that would introduce non-rowers to
this new activity.

Additionally, recruitment of coaching staff and

student athletes would be improved with the construction of a boathouse.

### New Value of Program: 

A boathouse would protect Saline Area Schools equipment, and most importantly
provide a facility for additional training and the opportunity for a community
partnership with Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti Township and Saline
residents, and possible future nearby communities. (Note that the forecasted
possible removal of Argo Dam in Ann Arbor may create the need for all 3 Ann
Arbor High Schools to relocate their rowing programs to Ford Lake).

The construction of the boathouse would also be an opportunity to create a
partnership with the South and West Washtenaw Consortium: Building Trades and
allow for student input to create a green facility that benefits all members
using the facility.

Rent a Rower /Hire a Crew
-------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Rent a Rower/Hire a Crew](/assets/images/rentarower.png)

### Crew Families

This is probably one of the easiest ways for a rower to raise funds to reduce
their individual fees. Spread the word, post a few posters around town and also
put a lawn sign out. The cost of the posters is nothing. A lawn sign is around
$15.00. The cost is easily offset with just a few hours worth of work.
