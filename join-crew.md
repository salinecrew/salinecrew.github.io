The Saline High School Crew Club is a club sport for both men and women. The
club was founded in 2004 and is managed by a board of directors, comprised of
parents, coaches and team captains.

We have two competitive rowing seasons: Fall and Spring. The Fall season
consists of longer races (like cross country) and the Spring is Sprint Season
(like track). Most new rowers join in the Fall to get experience, learn to row,
and prepare for the head to head competition in the Spring.

The team is self-funded in part by the parents, the student-rowers themselves,
external support, and fundraisers such as the Great Gatsby Regatta. Although
this is a club team, the team rows against varsity teams of other high schools
and rowers can earn their Varsity letter. The club does not have cuts, and no
prior rowing experience or knowledge is expected.

1.  Crew tans are really *cooool*.
2.  It's one sport that you can do sitting down, going backwards.
3.  You'll have a new love for water...no matter how cold it is.
4.  It's a total body workout that will get you in shape for bikini weather
    (Speedo for the guys).
5.  Its the only sport that started as a punishment.
6.  Practice is on a beautiful lake.
7.  You learn how to take care of blisters.\

     *The rare and exotic ejecting crab maneuver*\
9.  Next time you ride in any kind of boat, you can babble on and on using
    technical boat terms and people will think you're an accomplished seaman.

A Little History and Some Accomplishments
-----------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Paddle](/assets/images/oar_hornet_gupy.jpg)

Saline High Crew began as the result of a student promoting rowing to other high
school students. The transfer student had recently moved from a Grand Rapids
high school with an established rowing program and was interested in continuing
to participate in this water sport. Saline was fortunate to have 2 teachers that
had university coaching and rowing experience that were able to organize and
lead a new program.

The team began with a parent board of 5 volunteers, 14 student athletes and the
generosity of a Lenawee County family that donated usage of their property,
launch & motor, and home on Sand Lake for the team to use. Additionally, the
Wyandotte Boat Club hauled 2 boats from their Detroit River facility and lent
their equipment during the first season of this new program. 

The Community Education program, under the leadership of Scot Graden, provided
guidance in writing bylaws and obtaining the necessary liability and equipment
insurance coverage for the fledging program.

The following year, an anonymous donor provided a substantial interest-free loan
to enable the program to purchase a trailer to haul the boats and the teams’
first used boats. Annual golf fundraisers have also added appreciably to the
teams’ revenues. The team also initiated two “Learn to Row” events at Argo Pond
near the Ann Arbor Rowing Club, to introduce Saline families to rowing.

The team has grown to over 50 athletes participating during each spring season
and approximately 45 athletes participating during each fall season. The Team
sponsored the first high School regatta at Ford Lake during Fall, 2007,
introducing Pioneer & Huron’s Crew teams to this local waterway. 

Both the girls and boys team have medaled at several Midwest regional regattas
(Columbus, Fort Wayne, and Cincinnati) and the Lightweight boys 4+ boat competed
at the American Schoolboy Championship in Tennessee in Spring, 2008, finishing
5th nationally. The team has been fortunate to retain excellent coaches and
alumni student coaches to assist with the program.
